Pipestat is a tool that works with instruction traces. It distills and
cross-references the information contained within them into an
assembly-source centered report. It can read either a M1 scrollpipe file
or a qtrace-format instruction trace. M1 scrollpipe files contain all
the information that is in an instruction trace and adds cycle-by-cycle
annotations of pipeline events that occurred during the execution of
each instruction.
